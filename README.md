## Roles
### Candidate -> Community Manager -> Regional Head

As for the roles, in principle, we follow Astar's ambassador program.
Therefore, you will start as a Candidate. 

We will review your commitment and progress in the first two months and decide if you are ready to take on the responsibility as a community manager.
As a rule, the tasks that need to be performed by Candidates and Community Manager remain the same. However, when you are promoted to Community Manager, you will receive bonus tokens in addition to the basic rewards. The bonus amount and rewards are still being worked out.

If you gain experience as a community manager over a certain period of time and show high commitment and performance, you will be promoted to Regional Head and will receive an additional bonus. (The amount of the bonus and the role of Regional Head are still being worked out)

## Program Contents

In principle, we follow Astar's New Program.

・There will be basic tasks and supplementary tasks every month.

- Supplementary tasks are optional but **should be done at least once a month**.
- There is no upper limit to the number of tasks you can do, so you can do as many as you like. For example, it is OK to do the same task more than once.
- Each task is given specific points and you need to achieve at least 50% of the total points to qualify to receive the rewards.
- If you achieve 100%, you will get the full rewards. If you achieve only 50%, you will get half of the full rewards.
- If we have extra ARSW tokens, they are often carried over to the next month.
- We will run this program for 4 months on a trial basis. The start date will be at the time of release and the end date will be 4 months after the release.
- The release date will be right after Astar's main net launch.
- If you fail to earn 50% of the points in both of the two month Candidate periods, you will be required to exit the community program.
- We are still working on the reward pool. For us, our mission is to contribute to the Astar ecosystem, and we are looking at designs that will contribute the most to Astar.
